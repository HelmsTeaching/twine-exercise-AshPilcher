This is a sample Twine game that gets players thinking about responding to context. Players are asked to respond to various scenarios by choosing the "best" option based on the information they are given. Whether I am writing and building (creating/making/etc. in any of it's forms), I start by asking what needs done and how best to do it. This is something I think is a fundamental piece of building and writing and what I wanted to bring to life in this game.
